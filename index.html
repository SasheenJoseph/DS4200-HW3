            <p>Hi! My name is Sasheen Joseph (most people call me Sasha), and I’m a Psychology major with minors in Data Science, Computational Social Sciences, and Sociology.  Even though being a student comes first, I have a huge passion for music. Ever since I can remember, music has been one of my favorite ways to unwind, explore emotions, and find inspiration. Over time, I started making playlists not just as a hobby but as a form of creative expression. Each playlist I make has its own theme, vibe, and mood, and I try to capture those little moments or feelings that are so often hard to put into words.
                </p>
            <p>I chose to create this site around my Spotify playlists because I think a lot can be shared through music. Whether it's a chill vibe for a quiet afternoon, a throwback to classic hits, or some hype tracks for the gym, there's something in here for everyone. I choose three of my most listened to playlist to showcase in this assignment. I’m excited to share a bit of my world with you here—and hopefully, you’ll find a playlist that makes your day a little better. Thanks for stopping by, and happy listening!<br><a href="playlists.html" class="button-link">Explore My Playlists</a></p>
